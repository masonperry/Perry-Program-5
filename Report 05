A Simple Role Playing Game Code.
Using what we learned about Classes, methods, and attributes.

Important Variables:

Starting with the Items folder which was easy to piece together.
Items.py
Treasure is the class, there is no object.
list of definitions, I wanted to make it so items could be (un)equipped/eaten/looked at/picked up. I had the concept, using 0’s and 1’s, on/off, but implementing it just confused me, and it was getting to complex and messy for me to connect them in the world, and to the player.

I used “entity” a lot basically as the being, weather it was a person, mob, or item.

Treasures:
Weapons - what can be used to fight, worth in gold, and damage they can deal.
Armory - description, worth, protection.
Food - gives food their description, nutritional value, worth.
Bank - lets player know how much gold they have.

Directory.py is the module, after importing the other files.
I organized each of the items together.

In the Player folder, it was a little more tricky.

Player.py
Player_info is the class.
In Name.py, class name, I define, entity, species, experience, health and attack damage, for every character in the game.

In Directory.py, I have a Main Characters, Antagonists, Non-playable Characters, and Enemies. Giving a variety of characters to play as.

I wanted to add an input where the player could choose a character.the main problem I kept having was picturing this code as a computer game, like Minecraft, and not a py game.

Which brings me to Levels I started to create code for it.

I wanted to make it so it would generate the grid, which I know how to do.

################
#             *#
#    *         #
#              #
#      C     * #
#    *         #
#              #
#*            *#
################

and the character “C” would spawn in the center which would be 0,0. and then enemies would come in “*” from different angles, toward the character, and the character would eliminate them.
but I think I was over complicating it. Got frustrated, so I did not.

That was the big problem with this program, I understood what I had to do, but I had no idea how to go about it, even after seeking help.
